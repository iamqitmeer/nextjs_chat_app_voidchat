## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.x or later recommended)
*   `npm` or `yarn`
*   A Google account to create a Firebase project

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/iamqitmeer/nextjs_chat_app_voidchat.git
    cd nextjs_chat_app_voidchat
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up Firebase**
    *   Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
    *   Go to **Project Settings** > **General** tab.
    *   Under "Your apps", click the Web icon (`</>`) to add a new web app.
    *   Register the app and copy the `firebaseConfig` object. You will need these credentials.
    *   In the console, go to **Authentication** > **Sign-in method** and enable an authentication provider (e.g., Google, Email/Password).
    *   Go to **Firestore Database** and create a new database in **Test mode** (for easy setup).
    *   Go to **Storage** and create a default storage bucket.

4.  **Configure Environment Variables**
    *   Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of your project.
    *   Add your Firebase configuration details to this file:
    ```.env.local
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID="YOUR_APP_ID"
    ```

5.  **Run the Development Server**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

##  Firestore Data Structure

To help you understand the database schema, here's a brief overview:

*   **`users` collection:**
    *   Stores information for each registered user (e.g., `uid`, `displayName`, `email`, `photoURL`).
*   **`chats` collection:**
    *   Each document represents a unique chat room between two users. The document ID is a sorted, concatenated string of the two user UIDs (e.g., `uid1_uid2`).
    *   Contains a `members` array and a `call` object for WebRTC signaling.
    *   **`messages` sub-collection:**
        *   Each document is a message within that chat, containing `text`, `senderId`, `createdAt`, `type`, `mediaUrl`, etc.
